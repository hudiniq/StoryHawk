# Story Hawk RPG
In Hawk characters and dungeon master tell a story together. The system enables them to do so with some mechanics that introduce an element of chance. It is played in a way where a DM sets the general picture of the story and helps characters resolve conflict and challenges.

Hawk keeps most RPG elements present but kept at a simple level, not to bog down the storytelling aspect.  
It is played on the basis of skill proficiencies, utilities and angles.
- Personal traits, professions and personal skills are handled by **Proficiencies**.
- Magic items, spells, blessings and similar are handled by **Utilities**.
- Use of environment, NPCs and other beneficial elements of the world are handled by **Angles**.

Collection of all these bonuses and a die roll resolve **Challenges** that have a Difficulty Challenge threshold, set by the DM. Rolling above the threshold results in success, and rolling below in failure.  
Three consecutive failures against a larger goal result in irreversible **Disaster**.


## Mechanics

### Proficiencies
Proficiency Bonus is gained on a skill by skill basis as you use and level up a skill. Every level in a particular skill represents +1 PB.

Using a skill and successfully overcoming a difficult challenge, will result in gaining XP and potentially skill levels.

### Utilities
Some skills require tools to preform an action. For example picking locks requires you to use lockpicks, whereas
persuasion doesn't necessarily require anything.  
Basic set of tools enables you to do so and add +1 UB to your check,
while better variants of the tool might add a larger bonus, either flat or in form of a die.

Weapons, magic items, spells, boons/blessings, ... all fall under the broad category of utilities and act in the same way as tools.

### Angles
Some challenges surpass the capabilities of an individual or a small group. There you need to find additional angles
to boost your chances. An angle can contribute varying amount of bonus (AB) to your checks.
Gather as many as you can to ensure success.

*An angle can be a rare piece of knowledge to assist you at navigating a dungeon, favour/help of an entity,
an insight into the movement of enemy patrols, or a hostage that can improve your negotiating position.*

### Challenges
If a task has a chance of failure (and if the possibility of that failure contributes to the story) it has a
difficulty challenge (DC). A character attempts to beat it with a skill check.  
The challenges are often meant to be tackled by pre-planning and gathering resources and bonuses.

|   DC  |  Level  |                Description                 |
|:-----:|:-------:|--------------------------------------------|
| 11-20 | Easy    | Anyone has a chance to succeed.            |
| 21-30 | Normal  | Some skills, tools or angles are required. |
| 31-40 | Hard    | Group effort and outside help required.    |
| 41-50 | Great   | High level or a lot of help required.      |
|  50+  | Grand   | Grand scale operation.                     |

Note: Any check where 10+bonuses (average roll) would differ from the DC for 10 or more, can be resolved without rolling.

### Checks
If d20+PB+UB+AB >= DC ---> Success  
if DC > 10+PB ---> 1 skill XP

A roll of 20 is an automatic success and a roll of 1 is an automatic failure. *They are a good way to bring flavour as great luck or misfortune.*

Any other character may add half of their total bonuses (min 1) of a skill that could contribute to the solution.
  
If DM decides an action is worthy of "divine favour" or it's simply done from an advantageous position, he can grant Advantage to the roll. (Rolling twice keeping the highest.)
The characters have no way to influence that choice directly, other than making immersive choices. Same goes for Disadvantage.

### Disaster
A DM should log failures against larger goals such as combat, risky negotiations, puzzles, ... Any three consecutive failures mean a disaster. Death, imprisonment, or any other irreversible outcome.


## Fundamentals

### Skills
There is no predefined set of skills. A character may grow skill in any masterable aspect of life.
Any check is done on the grounds of a skill, but can be omitted if not relevant.

- Maximum skill level is 20.
- Maximum number of skills is 10.

To level up a skill - accumulate 10+PB XP for every skill level, or flat 10 XP for innate skills.  
Anytime you gain XP you can choose to loose the same amount in another skill.

You gain 1 XP anytime you succeed a check where DC > 10+PB.

Skill XP or levels may also be rewarded by DM for appropriate character actions or downtime activities.

### Character creation
At character creation choose:
- 3 **innate skills** in which you will gain XP quicker
- 3 skills where you get a **starting bonus** of +2 PB.

*Optionally* A DM might choose to start characters off with a racial innate skill or starting bonus.  
*Optionally* A DM might choose to start characters off with another utility.

You can substitute any number of starting bonuses with a basic set of tools or any other utility, such as a spell.

Every character can start off with a reasonable amount of mundane weapons and other adventuring equipment of their choice.

### Skill locks
A DM may choose to only allow an attempt/check above a certain skill level, but must me explicit about it beforehand.

Generally an action can be attempted without any prior skill, but some actions might require basic familiarity with an appropriate skill.  
*For example any speech related checks can be attempted at any or no skill level, but an attempt to enchant a weapon would require you to have some prior familiarity with enchanting.*


## Examples and guidelines

### Scale
The system was designed with an epic scale in mind. Meaning the events should be sequenced with longer periods of time in between. That doesn't mean that small scale interactions should be avoided. Conversation, an involved puzzle and similar elements are still the corner stone of any good adventure.

*For example, a visit to the town should be described on a larger scale, with characters expressing their intents beforehand and only pane in on the characters point of view where it's necessary. Travel from that town to the destination takes a few days of travel. In between characters can set intentions to do different things, which can be resolved from the characters point of view only if the resolution requires more interaction. However at the destination, the puzzle should still be complex with many parts and checks and perhaps even branching paths.*

### Character creation
We are creating an example character who is a soldier, serving his ranks as a scout. For flavour; his interest is in poisons and his missions often involved poisoning enemy supplies.

- For his innate skills we choose **sneaking**, **perception** and **making poisons**.
- DM decided the characters start off with a set of tools, so he starts out with a **poisoner's kit**.
- His military training and personal interests give him starting bonus in **archery**, **sneaking** and **poison making**.

The equipment he's carrying is common clothes with a grey cloak, leather armour, two short blades, a short bow and a backpack with all basic adventuring gear such as torches, rope, blanket, cooking utensils and a tinderbox. He's also carrying a belt pouch with a handful of ball bearings.

### Combat
Combat can either be tackled in a series of events or a single encounter. The characters could either prepare a whole strategy, gather insight, accumulate different angles and overcome the challenge on a large scale. They could also dive in and use any angles that present themselves on the fly, in a series of smaller encounters.

It's best to ruin the adventure flexible enough, so the players can decide on what level of granularity they would tackle an encounter. Usually the story best narrates the need.

### Challenges and disaster
It's DM's job to call out checks when a situation arises. A check should contribute to the story by introducing chance. Use it only when you have some idea where failure could progress the story. Using challenges can be a great way to branch out story, limit and enrich progression. When setting a DC, take into account the amount of potential AB available for specific challenge.

Disaster mechanic is a way to introduce tension and help set some mechanical rules of when and how to handle defeat. Three consecutive failures should be a guideline not a strict rule. If there's no way to enforce a disaster, then you could simply progress the story to a point where you can and give the characters another chance, or continue with the story and reveal consequences down the line.

Depending on the people participating in the game, chance of death can be great for immersion.

### Magic items/spells
Even though magic items and spells don't have any mechanical systems to enrich, other than a UB, it doesn't mean they can't be interesting mechanically. An item of magical nature or a spell, should enable someone to do things in ways not usually available to a human.

*A wand of secrets, would enable is owner to discover any objects that were intended to be hidden, with ease; or a flaming spell to damage and ignite objects from a distance.*

### Downtime
Character, unskilled in smithing attempts to forge a sword. He obtained the blueprint and resources needed, spent a few weeks in a smithy learning the craft and consulting with the master smith. With his assistance and resources spent, the character attempts a skill check. d20+0+5+5 against a DC 20. Considering the preparation, failing to beat the DC may result in lesser end-product. *With the amount of downtime spent learning and preparing, the DM may award XP or level in smithing.* If no preparation would be made, simply attempting it only with blueprints, failing to beat the DC may not produce a result and success might only yield a lesser variant of the end product.
